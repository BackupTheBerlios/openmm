JammC - a UPnP-AV Media Controller
JammC (pronounced like "MC", the Master of Ceremony) is the "remote control" of your multimedia system.
It lets you select your media source (UPnP-AV Server), browse the content of the server, select a media object
(song, video, tv-channel), select a media output (UPnP-AV Renderer) and control the transport of the media
from source to output (start, stop, ...).

Quick'n dirty installation:
You need CMake 2.6 or later. Run the following commands:
$ cmake .
$ make
$ sudo make install

See the README of the Jamm-Project for more information.
