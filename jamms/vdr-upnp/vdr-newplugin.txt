The new plugin source directory has been created in ".//upnp-0.0.1".

The next steps you should perform now are:

* edit the file "README" to adjust it to your specific implementation
* fill in the code skeleton in "upnp.c" to implement your plugin function
* add further source files if necessary
* adapt the "Makefile" if necessary
* do "make all DVBDIR=/usr VDRDIR=/usr/include/vdr LIBDIR=." from the source
  directory to build your plugin
