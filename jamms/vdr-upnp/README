Description: Plugin to expose VDR's capabilities to the UPnP-AV world

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
VDR 1.6.0
VDR streamdev-server-plugin 0.3.4
JammLib 0.0.1
Platinum UPnP 0.4.6

Installation:
To build the plugin, you need CMake. Just run:
$ cmake .
$ make

Copy libvdr-upnp.so into the directory where vdr searches for plugins.
On Debian based systems, the following should work (as user root):

$ cp  libvdr-upnp.so /usr/lib/vdr/plugins/
$ cd /usr/lib/vdr/plugins/
$ ln -s libvdr-upnp.so libvdr-upnp.so.1.6.0

Edit /etc/vdr/plugins/streamdevhosts.conf and add your network.
If you are brave add the line:
0.0.0.0/0            # any host on any net (USE THIS WITH CARE!)

Otherwise, to grant just your local network access, this could look like (depending
on the ip-address of your LAN):
192.168.178.0/24     # any host on the local net

Add the following lines to vdr's setup.conf (on Debian usually in /var/lib/vdr/):
streamdev-server.AllowSuspend = 1
streamdev-server.SuspendMode = 1

To watch Live-TV and recordings, you can use the other UPnP-AV applications of the Jamm Suite:

JammR is a UPnP-AV Media Renderer and acts like the "set-top box" for you TV. It renders the media streams
coming from the VDR UPnP plugin to a screen and a sound system.

JammC is a UPnP-AV Media Controller and acts like the "remote control" of your multimedia system.
It lets you browse the TV channels and recordings exposed by the VDR UPnP plugin, select a UPnP-AV Renderer
and control the transport of the media (start, stop, seek, ...).
