install VDR plugin:

copy libvdr-upnp.so into the directory where vdr searches for plugins. On Debian based systems, the following should work:
cp  libvdr-upnp.so.1.6.0 /usr/lib/vdr/plugins/

make shure all dependencies are fullfilled. In case of jammr, this currently isi:
 version 0.1 of libplatinum.0.4.6,
 vdr streamdev-server-plugin 0.3.4
 and of course a working vdr of version 1.6.0 (if using another version, compile upnp-plugin against it)

edit /etc/vdr/plugins/streamdevhosts.conf and add your network. If you are brave add the line:
0.0.0.0/0            # any host on any net (USE THIS WITH CARE!)

otherwise, to grant just your local network access, this could look like (depending on the ip-address of your LAN):
192.168.178.0/24     # any host on the local net

add the following lines to vdr's setup.conf (on Debian usually in /var/lib/vdr/):
streamdev-server.AllowSuspend = 1
streamdev-server.SuspendMode = 1
