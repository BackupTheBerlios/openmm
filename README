1. Introduction

Omm is a set of applications and libraries for easily making your multimedia content available 
to your local network. It aims to be compatible to the UPnP V1.0 and UPnP-AV V1.0 specification.

Omm currently includes the following components:

OmmC - a UPnP-AV Media Controller
OmmC is the "remote control" of your multimedia system.
It lets you select your media source (UPnP-AV Server), browse the content of the server, select a media object
(song, video, tv-channel, ...), select a media output (UPnP-AV Renderer) and control the transport of the media
from Server to Renderer (start, stop, seek, ...). 

OmmR - a UPnP-AV Media Renderer
OmmR is the "set-top box" for you TV. It renders the media streams
coming from the UPnP-AV Server to a screen and a sound system.

OmmS - a set of UPnP-AV Media Servers
Currently only a plugin for VDR (Video Disc Recorder - http://www.cadsoft.de/vdr/) is available.
It gives you access to digital television provided by VDR (DVB-S, DVB-C or DVB-T). The plugin
exposes the TV channels, you can watch live-TV and the recordings. Seeking in recordings is
supported. For browsing the EPG or setting timers you need a web based interface like vdr-admin.
For delivering other content, such as music and video files (mp3, avi, ...) you can use one
of the UPnP-AV servers out there (see compatibility list below).

libomm
UPnP 1.0 implementation

libommav
UPnP AV 1.0 implementation

OmmSession
A set of images, ready to boot and to provide you with the capabilities of OmmC, OmmR and/or OmmS.

2. Building from Source

To build Omm from source you need CMake as of version 2.6 or later. In the top-level directory
just run:

$ ./cmake
$ make
$ sudo make install

and you should be done.

Alternatively you can run

$ ./cmake.sh install

in the top-level directory. This will create the directory
../ommbin and does an out-of-tree build in it.

You can also build each sub-project seperately by changing into the sub-project's directory 
(for example omm/controller/) and doing the (cmake; make; sudo make install) triple.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Dependencies

Currently, all Omm components depend on the Platinum UPnP library 0.4.6 or later 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/platinum/). A tar-ball with a CMake build script is provided
on Omm's website for convenience. You can build a shared library called libplatinum-upnp.so with
it, just as Omm expects it to find on your system. Further dependencies are:

OmmC: Qt 4.4.3 or later
OmmR: X with support for xvideo is currently recommended
OmmR VLC engine: libvlc (as of vlc 0.9.4 or later)
OmmR mplayer engine: mplayer at least 1.0 pre-something installed as a runtime dependency
OmmR xine engine: libxine 1.1.15 or later
OmmS-vdr: VDR 1.6.0 with streamdev-server plugin

The mplayer engine has an incredible good seek performance on http streams, but has some flaws when
it comes to controlling it via IPC.

VLC has a clean library design and an overall good performance, especially on mpeg streams via http.
That's nice for TV streaming. However, seeking and AV-Transport related control is not as fast as mplayer's.

The xine engine is imcomplete and probably not working. Seeking on http streams is not implemented in
libxine, so this should be done first do reactivate it for Omm.

So, currently I recommend the VLC engine.

4. Running the Applications

This is pretty straight forward: just run ommc or ommr on a single or on several different machines.
No configuration is needed, in the first place. All UPnP-AV Servers and UPnP-AV Renderers announce
themselves on the local network and then pop up in OmmC. You can quit or start a second OmmC while
some media is rendered, so different instances of OmmC can concurrently control one playing media.
On the other hand, one instance of OmmC can control different instances of OmmR, for example one
in the living-room and one in the kitchen. Your mileage may vary.

OmmS-vdr must be installed as a vdr-plugin, usually in /usr/lib/vdr/plugins. The streamdev-plugin must be
configured and working on the standard ports. Don't forget to add:

streamdev-server.AllowSuspend = 1
streamdev-server.SuspendMode = 1

to vdr's setup.conf, to enable changing of transponders on the stream's request.

5. Compatibility

Currently, only Mediatomb (http://mediatomb.cc) has been tested to work nicely with the Omm applications. Please give
feedback, if you have tested others.

I hope you enjoy Omm as much as I enjoy hacking on it
